I'm an experienced VP of R&D, with over two decades of technological leadership across various startups and global companies. My expertise spans mobile development (iOS & Android), cloud/SaaS development using platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as managing large-scale, multidisciplinary projects. I have a rich background in technologies such as Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Postgres, MongoDB, and microservices.

Most recently, I led Meta's authentication services, managing products impacting over 2 billion users. Prior to that, I held leadership roles in a stealth-mode cybersecurity startup, working with top researchers to tackle complex challenges, and at Somoto Inc., where I multiplied revenues while reducing serving costs.

My technical and leadership skills allow me to build and scale both technical systems and teams, with a strong focus on efficiency, security, and user experience.
